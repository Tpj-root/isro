As of October 2025, the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), also known as NavIC, has **4 operational satellites**: IRNSS-1B, IRNSS-1F, IRNSS-1I, and NVS-01. These satellites are currently providing navigation services. However, the constellation is facing challenges, with several satellites either decommissioned or non-operational due to various issues. Efforts are underway to replace these satellites and maintain the system's effectiveness.

**Correct answer:**

**a. 7**

This reflects the original design of the system, which aimed for seven operational satellites. However, the current operational status is limited to four satellites.
