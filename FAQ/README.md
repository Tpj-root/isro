restrict to this last question which I think will will be a very good way to
end the talk so the question they ask is what role does astrochemistry play in
understanding the potential for life on other planets 


Prof Bhalamurugan Sivaraman : 


Wow yes, so

Astrochemistry is very important to, like, understand the potential of life on other planets.

Because it will tell us whether the molecules of life are made or not.

If it's carbon-based life, so far we are going with the basic assumption that it's all carbon-based life everywhere.

So, astrochemistry tells us, based on the availability of ingredients, whether life would have been made there or not.

Because astrochemistry can clearly say molecules of life will be made and if they can survive whatever the planetary conditions are, you know, where we want to look for life.

So yes, it's very, very important.

What can learning about exoplanets teach us about our own planet Earth?

CH yeah, there is one question, like, uh, from Tii: How can studying exoplanets help us better understand the conditions for life beyond Earth?


Prof. Abhijit Chakraborty


Okay, uh, very interesting question. You see, so far, we have only one example, one data point, that is Earth, and we have life on it, okay. 
So, just as I showed you, there is so much of a large zoo of different exoplanets, okay, but yet we have not come out with one single example of an Earth twin, 
where an Earth-like planet is going around the Sun-like star at a distance of 1 AU from the Sun with a one-year period of time, okay.

And so the idea is that the first basic question is: are we alone, okay? First is that. And secondly, how, you know, like, uh, how life has evolved on Earth. We still do not—I mean, we have some ideas and models—but if you see that, uh, if you look for planets around stars, let us say, which is somewhat in the beginning of its stage where life is getting formed, or its atmospheric conditions are not that of the current Earth, but at a situation where Earth was in the primal situation, like about 4 billion years ago.

So, identifying such, uh, such candidates in the future will help us to understand how, under those scenarios, life began to form, plus how life actually evolved.

So, when you have a large statistics, that statistics will give you how you can, uh, how, you know, like, life has evolved—actually, say, you know, like, um, it is like this: suppose you have a species whose whole lifetime is one day, let us say, and suppose this species, even though its lifetime is one day, it wants to—it is an intelligent life form—and it wants to study about human life, which typically, say, is 100 years. So, what it will do in one day, it cannot learn 100 years of life of a human being.

So, therefore, it will select samples from a child to an old man and then see how this is. So that is what is called statistics. So the statistics help us to understand, you know, how life evolved in the past on Earth and how it evolves generally in other planets, provided that we find such planets.

So far, we have not found such a planet, so the search is on.
