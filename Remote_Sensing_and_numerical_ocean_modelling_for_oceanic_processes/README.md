Remote Sensing and numerical ocean modelling for oceanic processes









reetings from IIRS Dehradun!

We are pleased to welcome you to the online training programme on “Remote Sensing and Numerical Ocean Modelling for Oceanic Processes”. This programme aims to provide participants with an in-depth understanding of oceanographic processes, applications of remote sensing, and the role of numerical models in monitoring and predicting ocean dynamics.

We look forward to your active participation and fruitful learning experience.
