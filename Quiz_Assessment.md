**L7-Towards a Better Understanding of the Sun-Earth Connection: Avenues for Next Two Decades**



```

The plasma drift direction due to the cross product of the electric field (E) and magnetic field (B) can be determined using the right-hand rule.

In this case:

    The electric field is eastward (along the positive x-axis).
    The magnetic field is northward (along the positive y-axis).

The E x B drift direction is perpendicular to both E and B. To find it, point the fingers of your right hand in the direction of E (east) and curl them towards B (north). Your thumb will point in the direction of the drift.

    Eastward (positive x-axis) Ã— Northward (positive y-axis) = Upward (positive z-axis).
    
    




The direction of the plasma drift (E x B) at ionospheric altitudes in the presence of an eastward electric field and a northward magnetic field is (consider Cartesian coordinate system)
a. Upward
b. Westward
c. Downward
d. Southward
